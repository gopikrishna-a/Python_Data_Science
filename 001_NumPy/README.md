# Introduction to NumPy:

* NumPy is a Linear Algebra library for Python, The reason it is so important for data science with python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData ecosystems rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.

* NumPy is also incredibly fast, As it has bindings to C libraries

#### Installing NumPy

* By running the following command in command line we can install numpy module

      pip install numpy


* NumPy arrays are essentially come in two flavors: Vectors ( 1D ) and metrices ( 2D )

* Vectors are strictly 1D arrays and materices are 2D ( but you should note a matrix can still have only one row or one column)
